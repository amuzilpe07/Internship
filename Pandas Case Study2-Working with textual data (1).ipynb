       "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""

       "'hypothetical situations abound, one-time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead, left in the streets, in the stores, and throughout the landscape, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. one lone survivor, attempting to rekindle his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. all alone, he hopes for more, but with nobody around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for a local indian tribe \\x96 until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence. alan, a man of the book, is left on earth after an unknown disaster. thinking he is alone, he begins living life his way \\x96 until, jeri ryan, appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled, and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like alan. anyway, they try to co-exist, fail, get drunk, and before creating the ultimate dystopia, they run into redneck raphael (played by newcomer \\x96 dan montgomery jr). bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock. even with nobody left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise.using a variable film technique, ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled \"the quiet earth\" (which i will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. with a borrowed story, i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride, borrowing yet again from other film director\\'s techniques to attempt to find his own. he opens the film interestingly enough, but fails to answer any direct answers. sure, the final days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer as to \"how\" or better yet \"why\" these select few survived. a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. the juxtaposition would have been like \"shawn of the dead\", but instead left us feeling like we were watching a \"made-for-tv\" program. listening to the audio commentary, i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made, and his passion nearly sells the film, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn\\'t as happy with his overall final product. there were mistakes, ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. while this does make for decent independent film-making, it sometimes feels cheap, and in ralston\\'s case, it was the latter.i must admit, david arnott\\'s portrayal of alan hooked me. he played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. he was funny to both watch and listen to, and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer. he was a key player in keeping the film together, alas, i cannot say the same for the rest. this was dan montgomery\\'s first film, and it was obvious \\x96 i mean \\x96 really really obvious. there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him, perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance, but alas, it wasn\\'t the case. then there was jeri ryan. she pulled into her character near the end of the film, which to me, was the culmination of the entire piece of art. she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end. confused? again, she fell into her character by the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured. even as the commentary progressed, all that she contributed was a laugh, giggle, or \"ohhh, look at that color\" moment. while her beauty may sell tickets, one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful. this was her first film, so can i be too harsh? overall, this film felt like it was missing something. i though the idea was strong \\x96 the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists. jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have. ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy. i think our idea of \"funny\" is different, so that is why i couldn\\'t find myself laughing at many of the bits he found \"hysterical\". his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film, which was lower than average. his film was loose, meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?), which overall harmed the intensity of the film. this was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much much funnier. for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film, as we learn from their commentary, all he was there for was money \\x96 the was in essence, the bank for \"the last man\". don\\'t get your hopes up for any classic avery moments.don\\'t expect more from ralston \\x96 and that is how i will end it.grade: ** out of *****'"

       "\"following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to che\\x97struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himself\\x97such a struggle is best told exactly as that\\x97a struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one man\\x97if anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who \\x96arguably- conducted the whole thing.yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. here, the basic structure of part one is echoed back\\x97there's the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note. this difference, in combination with the similarities to part one, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.indeed, everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenes\\x97the drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. in fact, upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one, and title the review as a whole, yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.with that said, i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that. with a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves, che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.- a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net)\""
